# A Colorful Space
 A game made using Unity game engine. The game was programmed using C# and 3D models were prepared using Blender.
 
 The game contains two modes: Challenge and Discovery. In the Challenge mode, the goal is to shoot orbs in different colors (red, green, or blue) with the bullets in different colors (red, green, or blue) to obtain the color specified (yellow, cyan, or magenta) on top, below the timer. The Challenge is played in waves and in each wave, player needs to obtain the specified color mixing the colors of the bullet and orbs, within the time limit (60 seconds).
 
 In the Discovery mode, players can mix the colors in the similar way as the Challenge mode to obtain the colors yellow, magenta, and cyan. These colors are used as currencies. Players can use these currencies to buy power-ups in Shop. The colors are obtained by hitting the orbs, not by shooting them as in the Challenge mode.
 
 In Shop, players can use the currencies that they obtained in the Discovery mode to buy 3 different power-ups:
Add Time:     Adds 10 more seconds to the timer
Keep Going:  When the game is over, players can keep going from where they left, with 20 extra seconds
Shoot Any:    For the current wave, players can shoot any orb to increase their scores, regardless of the specified color that needs to be obtained.
